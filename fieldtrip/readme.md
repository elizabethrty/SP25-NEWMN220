# Field Trip Project

## Artifact: Glass Bear Panel

### Project Summary
This project will function as an informational website focused on Larry Rosso's [Glass Bear Panel](https://collections.eiteljorg.org/objects/3362/glass-bear-panel?ctx=15a19842391290e74075cda47c0dedeff440331c&idx=0) created in 1999. I decided to focus on this artifact to provide users with a deeper understanding of the historical significance of artwork in Indigenous cultures. Each page will feature an in-depth explanation of either the artist, history, artwork process or the significance of the artifact.

### Core Webpages
**Home Page:** This will be the landing page for visitors. It will feature a short description of the project and will include buttons to direct users to the listed pages below.
**Artist Information:** This page will focus on the Artist, Larry Rosso. It will consist of a biography and a short, interactive multiple-choice quiz based on the information provided that users can complete for fun.
**Sandblasting Process:** Users can choose to click through a photo gallery with "back" and "next" buttons. Each photo will have a brief description of the sandblasting process. 
**Artifact Details:** Users will be able to click on highlighted portions of the artifact to learn about the symbolism, history, or medium specifications. There will be a puzzle activity on this page where users can drag and drop the correct pieces onto a template of the artifact.

### Design Choices
- The navigation for this website will be black with white text to ensure it's easily noticeable. In addition, any photos or highlights on this page will include a border to create separation.

**Reference Websites:**
**[National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/)**
**[History Channel](https://www.history.com/articles/why-did-the-dinosaurs-die-out)**

**Data Structure:**
- Local storage will be utilized to save quiz results.
- The images for the gallery will be in an array. When a user clicks on either button, the website will show the following image in the array.
- Puzzle activity will be made with arrays. It will then have logic to ensure the pieces are correct.
