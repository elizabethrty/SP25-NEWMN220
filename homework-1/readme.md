## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are often focused on solely providing information rather than creating an interactive experience for the user. For example, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) has a small amount of user interactivity by allowing users to search for a specific topic they are interested in. Still, the main purpose of this site is to provide information about the topic being searched. 
On the other hand, web apps are almost the complete opposite of websites and focus on user interactivity to perform specific tasks. For instance, [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), a web app that allows users to listen to songs, create playlists, and discover new artists, relies on user interactions. 

### VS Code & Extensions

Visual Studio Code is a customizable code editor which allows users to personalize their experience by installing extensions. The extensions recommended for this course are listed below with a brief explanation. 

- **Live Server**: Allows real time updates of your web page in a browser.
- **Prettier**: Automatically corrects your formatting making your code easier to read.
- **Auto Rename Tag**: Updates matching HTML tags automatically.
- **Code Spell Checker**: Checks for spelling mistakes as you work on your code.
- **Vscode Pets**: Adds cute and customizable pets!

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

- **Version Control**: This is a system that allows users to track any changes made to their code over time. 
- **Git**: This is a tool used for version control that allows you to track changes on your own device. Users can publish branches to upload the newest version to GitHub, changes can be saved by utilizing git commit, git pull receives recent updates from others, and lastly, git push shares the changes you have made with others. 
- **GitHub**: This web app allows users to store and track their projects online.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is an easy way to add customization to text without needing any external tools. It allows different options like headings, lists, italic/bold text. Using these makes information more organized and easier to understand.
