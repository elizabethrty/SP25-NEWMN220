# Weekly Recap
This week, I learned how to use const and let to declare variables, and how to use operators like += and -= to add or subtract values in JavaScript. I also learned how to use object wrappers to easily round numbers using Math.ceil and Math.floor. Lastly, using string methods allows text to easily be changed if needed.

## Declaring Variables
- var:
    - Do NOT use 
    - Outdated practice
- let: 
    - Values can be changed
    - Block scope
- const:
    - Values cannot be changed
    - Block scope

## Basic Operators & Object Wrappers
| Arithmetic Operators | Mathematical calculations|
| Assignment Operators | Assigning values |
|Comparison Operators | Compare values and returns Boolean's |
| Logical Operators | Combining conditions |
| Type Operators | Determine the type of a variable|
