# Weekly Recap
This week, I learned how to use const and let to declare variables, and how to use operators like += and -= to add or subtract values in JavaScript. I also learned how to use object wrappers to easily round numbers using Math.ceil and Math.floor. Lastly, using string methods allows text to easily be changed if needed.

## DOM Manipulation
- This allows websites to
    - Change text
    - Change colors
    - Add interactivity
    - Add or remove things from the page

## Arrays
    - Allows collections of data to be organized
    - Each value is stored in an index
        - Starts at 0
    - Useful for lists
    - Square brackets are recommended
### Looping Through Arrays
    - For loop: Used when you know the amount of times you would like to repeat something.
    - While loop: Used when you're unsure how many times you would like something to be repeated.
    - Do while loop: Will make sure the loop runs at least one time.
